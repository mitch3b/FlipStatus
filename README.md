# FlipStatus
Simple tool to display something in 3 horizontally aligned bars... where the righter you are, the more likely you are to update. For example:

[Thanks for] [the donation] [Jon]
[Thanks for] [the donation] [Matt]
[Thanks for] [nothing] [Dad]
[Thanks for] [the food] [Bill]
[Thanks for] [the food] [Phil]
[Thanks for] [the food] [Liv]
[Another Update] [blah] [gah]
